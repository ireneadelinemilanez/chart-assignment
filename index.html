			<p>More than 1.6 million New Yorkers who rely on SNAP saw their monthly grocery budgets shrink at the start of November. Although payments were later reissued, some recipients will face expanded work requirements in December, according to the Associated Press. 
			<p>Julia Wolfson, an associate professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, said SNAP benefits are one of the most effective forms of economic stimulus.</p>
			<p>"Those benefits help support businesses where people spend them, including grocery stores and farmers, thereby supporting local economies," Wolfson said.</p>
			<p>Federal research shows SNAP spending moves quickly through the economy, acting as a stabilizer during economic downturns. A USDA study found a hypothetical $1 billion increase in benefits would raise GDP by $1.54 billion and support more than 13,000 jobs. The study implies a GDP multiplier, or how a small spending change can lead to a larger change in total economic output, of 1.54.</p>

			<p>Each congressional district has an average population of about 740,000, but the share of residents receiving SNAP benefits varies widely.
			</p>
			<p>New York's 15th Congressional District, located within the Bronx, has the largest number of SNAP recipients, 272,857, and generates more SNAP-based economic activity than any other district.</p>
